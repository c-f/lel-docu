### Structure layer

The key element of LeL is to extract meta information from the notes and visualize them in a meaningful way.
This helps you to create multiple layers with ordinary plain text (markdown) files. These layers can be created via:

- file structure
- tags
- relations (graph)

See [Details](/usr/structure) for more.

### Action layer

LeL gives you a few tools to track certain actions. Some of them are:

- Command line logging
- Milestone logging
- Continues screen capture

See [Details](/user/misato) for more.

### Collaborative Sharing

One big aspect is sharing documents and collaboration with others. From our perspective the following conditions are essential to establish a secure sync:

- Stable and fast client (Sync)
- End-to-end-encryption
- Open-Source
- Revision / version history
- Easy to install / simple to configure

Unfortuantely LEL currently does not support all of these requirements (yet).
The good thing is that syncing is really easy, because only the content needs to be synced. Everything else is generated on the fly.

For syncing you can choose whatever fits you best. Personally i like seafile quite well, therefore this section quickly helps you to setup seafile instance in an automated way.

See [Details](/user/automation) fore more.
